🐍 Python Mini Projects

Welcome to the Python Mini Projects repository!

This collection of simple yet practical Python applications was created as part of a personal and academic effort to strengthen programming fundamentals. Each project focuses on core Python concepts such as conditionals, loops, functions, file handling, and the use of standard libraries. The goal is to apply theory in a hands-on way by solving real problems through code.

Whether you're a beginner, a student working on a thesis, or just exploring Python, these mini projects offer a great way to learn, practice, and build a solid coding foundation.
